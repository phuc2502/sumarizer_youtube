# AI YouTube Summarizer

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to summarize YouTube videos or podcasts efficiently. It uses state-of-the-art AI models and offers features to customize summaries in terms of tone and length.

## Features

- Summarize YouTube videos (video length depends on Groq API limits).  
  If you're using your own Groq API key, summary length support depends on your plan.  
  The summarizer has no internal limits—[check the Groq API docs](https://console.groq.com/docs/rate-limits#rate-limits) for exact usage details.
- Select summary language.
- Customize summaries with different tones and lengths.
- Cache management: summaries are cached for reuse to save computation.
- No database required; uses temporary storage.
- Download or copy generated summaries directly.
